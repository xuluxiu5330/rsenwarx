It contains various machine learning algorithm implementation in MATLAB(2018a).

Some important algorithms implemented are-

1.Gradient Descent Algorithms(Batch mode as well as Increamental mode)

2.Single Layer Perceptron(slp)

3.Regression

4.Multi Layer Perceptron(mlp), K-Means, K-Medoid

5.Self Organising Map(som), Fuzzy C-Means, Bayesian-Clasifier

Note-some files having tb inside file names are implemented with help of Matlab Tool Boxes.

For interprating algorithms, see lab folders(contains implementation) corresponding to assignment numbers(as pdf files).
